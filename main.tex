\section{Hobbies \& Interests}
\cvitem{Gaming}{I also enjoy playing video games as much as working on game development, I mostly game on PC or Consoles, and a few mobile games too. I like to learn the game mechanics, graphics or systems and deconstruct or think how they were implemented. Working on games has in many ways changed my personal experience while playing. Let's share our favorite games!}
\cvitem{Music \& Instruments}{Apart from games which made up a big part of my childhood, adulthood and beyond my love for music is a big part of who am I. I research and collect music from different eras and genres. I have a few years invested with the piano and some on classical guitar as well, and know a bit or two about music theory.}
\cvitem{Movies}{I may not consider myself on the level of some cinephiles, but it's something I do enjoy a lot. I've amassed a big library of good movies in my memory and have invested some time into looking for movies from many places and genres, always up to share some recommendations.}
