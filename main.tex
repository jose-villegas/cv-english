\section{Events \& Conferences}
{\textit{\textbf{Caracas - Venezuela }}}\cvitem{| Global GameJam 2016}{A 48 hours game jam global event. Collaborated in the game \hrefico{http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/haunt}{"The Haunt"} using Unity3D. I worked on the game design, level design, characters movement and interactions. The Haunt is a tag-like game, where the players start as werewolves and they have to find and touch a human to transform into humans, once they transform the objective is to stay human as long as possible using the environment.}
{\textit{\textbf{Caracas - Venezuela }}}\cvitem{| Global GameJam 2015}{Collaborated in the game \hrefico{http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/kidz-solution}{"Kidz Solution"} using Unity3D along with many teammates on different roles. I worked on the game concept, artificial intelligence, interface and game mechanics. In Kidz Solutions kids have to save adults from different enemies in a post-apocalyptic world.}
{\textit{\textbf{Caracas - Venezuela }}}\cvitem{| 5th JOINCIC 2012}{A computer science conference with many talks and courses of different topics on computer science such as web development, game development, robotics, parallel computing, data processing, etc.}
{\textit{\textbf{Caracas - Venezuela }}}\cvitem{| CEIDEC 2012 -  UCV GameDev Contest}{A scientific research and development conference with a broad range of talks from different areas such as maths, physics, biology and computer science. Developed the game \hrefico{http://www.elchiguireliterario.com/2012/11/20/resumen-del-ucv-gamedev-contest-2012/}{"Hybris"} using Unity3D along with many teammates on different roles for the GameDev Contest, I worked mostly on artificial intelligence and game mechanics. Hibris is a god game where the player has to save humanity from imminent doom using different powers.}

\section{Hobbies \& Interests}
\cvitem{TV / Animated Series}{I enjoy watching comedies, documentaries, mystery shows, comics, dramas, a bit of anime.}
\cvitem{Gaming}{Of course I enjoy playing video games, mostly casual games on PC or Consoles, some mobile games too. I also sometimes like to learn the game mechanics and deconstruct or think how some of them were implemented. Working on games has kinda changed the experience of playing them.}
\cvitem{Real Time Rendering}{Just reading about techniques to generate high quality computer graphics in real time, interesting shaders, GPU computing, graphics APIs and new possibilities within the rendering pipeline.}
