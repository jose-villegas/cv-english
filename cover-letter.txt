Hello, I'm a Unity Developer with over 7 years of experience in the industry focused on mobile development for Android and iOS on LiveOps. I'm currently residing in Berlin with a Chancenkarte VISA looking to get back into what I love doing, which is making games.

I've been involved in multiple parts of game development: From the idea phase, initial pitch, first MVP and initial controlled launch. To keeping a successful gaming running with new features, improvements and fixes while getting our analytics stable and growing. My forte is gameplay and graphics, as my career background comes from Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Graphics, but my experience has also let me be proficient in multiple areas of game development, from SDK integration, bug fixing, optimization, building our continuous integration pipeline (Jenkins and Travis-CL), in-engine and external tool development, live content updates (AssetBundles and Addresasbles),  optimization and many others. 

In some of my previous roles, we have managed to increase multiple important analytics, such as retention and conversion rate, combined with user acquisition campaigns and data analysis. I also have experience leading teams as per my last role as Lead Programmer, mentoring and managing other developers, setting code standards for scalability and robustness, and collaborating with the rest of the team on feature planning and design. I consider myself good at reducing complex technical issues into something that can be understood by other fields within a team or my own engineering peers.

Furthermore, I hope my profile is attractive to you, and thanks for the opportunity.
