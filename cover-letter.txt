Hello there Kolibri! Well I'm really interested in this position. After reading all about the culture values, playing Kolibri's games and reading the offer I firmly believe I would be a great fit for this position, I would love the learn more about the role and the company.

As a quick summary about myself I'm a game developer with 5 years of professional experience. I have worked on some really successful games such as Operate Now: Hospital, and Banana Kong as well as many other games that are mentioned in my resume as well detailed in my webpage. As a programmer I have a strong focus on reusability, good practices and scalable and well-thought software architecture design. As a game developer I have gained a lot of understanding on different areas such as gameplay, AI, shaders / visual effects, game design, back-end support, optimizations, balancing, as well as some leading skills from my time with Operate Now.

Appreciate your time and I look forward to hearing more about the offer. Last suggestions, checkout my portfolio, https://jose-villegas.github.io/, I share there more details about my past roles as well as some personal projects, some that are games, others related to graphics programming. In fact I have been doing a game that uses Zenject and UniRX during quarantine I have that there too.

Warm regards, stay safe, Jose.
